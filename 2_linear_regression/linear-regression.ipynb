For example, a 1% fluctuation on a $100 stock is $1, while a 1% fluctuation on a $1000 stock is $10. An additive noise model assumes the magnitude of the noise is independent of the price level.

        "\n",
        "*   **Ensuring Non-Negativity:** The logarithm function is only defined for positive values. By modeling $\\log(\\textrm{price})$, any predicted value for $y$ will correspond to a positive price when you exponentiate it ($\\textrm{price} = e^y$). This naturally handles the non-negativity constraint of prices, which is a major issue with the simple additive Gaussian noise model on the raw price.\n",

        "    If the logarithm of the multiplier is approximately normally distributed with constant variance, then the additive noise assumption becomes more appropriate for the log-price. This is often a more realistic assumption for financial time series.\n",
        "*   **Handling Heteroscedasticity:** Taking the logarithm can also help to stabilize the variance of the noise across different price levels. In many cases, the variance of the *percentage* change in price is more constant than the variance of the absolute change in price. Since the logarithm transforms percentage changes into additive differences, it can lead to more homoscedastic residuals (constant variance noise) in the log-price space, which aligns better with the assumptions of linear regression.\n",

        "*   **Discrete Price Movements (Tick Size):** Stock prices don't move in continuous increments. They move in discrete steps called \"ticks\". For most stocks, the tick size is $0.01 (one cent). For pennystocks, this discrete movement is a much larger *percentage* of the stock price.\n",
        "    *   **Why this is a bigger problem for cheap stock:** If a stock is priced at $100, a $0.01 tick size is a 0.01% change. If a pennystock is priced at $0.10, a $0.01 tick size is a 10% change. This means that the price movements of pennystocks are inherently more lumpy and less like the continuous fluctuations assumed by many models (including those based on log-prices with continuous noise). The discrete nature of price changes becomes a dominant factor.\n",
        "*   **Bid-Ask Spread:** The difference between the price at which you can buy a stock (ask price) and the price at which you can sell it (bid price) is called the bid-ask spread. For pennystocks, this spread is often a much larger percentage of the stock price than for higher-priced stocks. This makes it difficult to define a single \"price\" for the stock and introduces significant transaction costs that models need to account for.\n",
        "*   **Low Liquidity and Manipulation:** Pennystocks often have low trading volume (low liquidity). This means that large buy or sell orders can have a significant impact on the price, making them more susceptible to manipulation. Models trained on historical data might not accurately predict prices influenced by such factors.\n",
        "*   **Lack of Data Quality and Availability:** Data for pennystocks can sometimes be less reliable or harder to obtain than for larger, more established stocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "While regressing on the logarithm of the price helps with the non-negativity and multiplicative noise assumptions, the discrete nature of price movements (the tick size) is a significant challenge for pennystocks. The assumption of continuous price paths, which underlies many financial models and the idea of continuous noise in log-price regression, breaks down for very low prices where the tick size is a substantial fraction of the price. This is a limitation that needs to be considered when applying continuous models to discrete, low-valued assets. The Black-Scholes model, for instance, assumes continuous trading and continuous price movements, which is a poor fit for the realities of pennystocks."

Specifically, for a Poisson distribution (which is often a good model for counts), the variance is equal to the mean. A Gaussian additive noise model assumes a constant variance ($\\sigma^2$) regardless of the predicted number of apples, which is unlikely to be true for count data where larger counts tend to have larger variability.\n",

This can help navigate the non-smoothness of the absolute value loss and lead to smoother convergence.\n",

This would make the loss function differentiable everywhere, allowing standard gradient-based optimization to work more smoothly. However, this changes the objective function slightly.\n",
